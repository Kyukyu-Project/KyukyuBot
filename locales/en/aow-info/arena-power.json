            "description": "Each troops and hero has a power rating (<:aowpower:849194035733069828> symbol) which depends on the unit’s rarity and level. The sum of power ratings of all units used is the power rating of an army.\nWhen you do battles in Arena and Hero Trials, the game shows the power rating of your opponent’s *defensive formation*. The power rating doesn’t necessarily correlate to the strength of an army. In general, two armies with less than 300k power rating difference are considered even."
