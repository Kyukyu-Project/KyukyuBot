The sum of power ratings of all units used is the power rating of an army.\n• You can see a player’s current attack power (<:atkpower:849194035733069828>) and defense power (<:defpower:968339445512306748>) in the player’s profile page.\n• The power rating doesn’t necessarily correlate to the strength of an army. In general, two armies with less than 300k power rating difference are considered even."
